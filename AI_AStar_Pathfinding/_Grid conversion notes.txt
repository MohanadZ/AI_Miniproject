1) The grid is iterated over by starting at y = max to 0 and x = 0 to max, which is done in a nested for-loop.

2) The object x-coordinat√© in Unity is sent as y-index number in the Python matrix, and the object y-coordinate is sent as x-index in the Python matrix.
Then, the x-index is subtracted from the grid size (32). The reason is that y = [0, 32] in Unity is equivalent to x = [32, 0], or in other words when y = 0 in Unity, it is represented by x = 32 in Python.

3) Once the path is received in Unity, the x-index is added to a List that represents the y-coordinates in Unity, which has the grid size (32) subtracted from it in order to convert it back to the y-axis in Unity. If x-index = 32 in Python, the y-coordinate = 0 in Unity.
The y-index is added to a List that represents the x-coordinate in Unity.

4) Each pair of coordinates is added to a list that represents the path. The seeker then moves towards the target by updating its position through moving it towards the next tile on the path.
